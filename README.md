# Workflows & Actions Collection

A collection of reusable GitHub Actions and workflow templates for the Open‑CMSIS‑Pack ecosystem to automate CI/CD
pipelines, enforce quality standards, and streamline DevOps processes across repositories.

## Purpose

Centralize GitHub automation patterns for:

- Workflows and CI/CD practices adopted by Open-CMSIS-Pack
- Serve as a central index of common reusable scripts/configs/workflows usage within the ecosystem

This helps maintain consistent best practices across repositories and reduces duplication.
